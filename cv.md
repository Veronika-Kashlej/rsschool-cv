## **About me**

I am an aspiring front-end developer with a strong passion for creating visually appealing and user-friendly web applications. What drew me to this field is the constant evolution of front-end technologies, which allows me to combine my creativity and problem-solving skills.
As a dedicated learner, I am committed to staying up-to-date with industry trends and continuously expanding my skillset. My key strengths include proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have a strong understanding of responsive design principles and cross-browser compatibility.
I am eager to join a dynamic and innovative team where I can put my skills to the test and learn from experienced professionals. My passion for front-end development, combined with my commitment to continuous learning, makes me a strong candidate for a junior front-end developer role.

## **Skills**

* HTML5, CSS3
* JavaScript
* Git, GitHub
* VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, VS
* Adobe Photoshop, Figma

## **Code example:**

```
The rgb function is incomplete. Complete it so that passing in RGB decimal values will result in a hexadecimal representation being returned. Valid decimal values for RGB are 0 - 255. Any values that fall out of that range must be rounded to the closest valid value.

Note: Your answer should always be 6 characters long, the shorthand with 3 will not work here.

function rgb(r, g, b) {
  return r.toString(16)+g.toString(16)+b.toString(16) + '000';
}
```
